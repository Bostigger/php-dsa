# PHP Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

## Introduction
Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms Repository! This repository is a comprehensive collection of various data structures and algorithms implemented in [Programming Language]. It serves as a personal reference and an educational resource for anyone interested in learning more about the fundamental building blocks of computer science and software engineering.

## Contents
This repository is organized into two main sections: Data Structures and Algorithms.

### Data Structures
Here, you'll find implementations and explanations for a variety of data structures, including but not limited to:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly and Doubly Linked Lists)
- Stacks
- Queues
- Hash Tables
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees)
- Heaps
- Graphs

### Algorithms
In this section, the focus is on algorithmic techniques and problem solutions, covering:
- Sorting (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Searching (Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search)
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking
- Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra's, A*, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall)
- Pattern Searching

## Usage
Each data structure and algorithm is contained in its own directory

To use this repository, clone it locally and navigate to the directory of the data structure or algorithm you're interested in. Sample code can be run directly if [PHP] is installed on your system.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Bostigger/php-dsa.git
cd php-dsa/[specific-data-structure-or-algorithm]
